RGB Mod for JVC AC CRT televisions.

Written by Brendan Eddy (FlyingFlygon)

## Overview

This JVC D-Series chassis includes support for analog RGB through the micom's OSD video signals. You can tap in between the OSD's output and the Y/C Jungle's input to inject your external RGB signals through a common connector such as SCART or BNC. In this guide we will be utilizing SCART, made easier with help of Sunthar's mux board, more on that later. 

## Components Needed

TODO Brendan change this if 220 termination resistors ends up bad

* 4 1n4148 diodes
* 6 220 Ohm resistors (3 for RGB inline, 3 for RGB termination)
* 2 1k Ohm resistors
* 1 SCART female port
* (Optional) Sunthar SCART mux board
